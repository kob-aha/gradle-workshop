# Gradle Workshop

Hi! Welcome to the **Gradle Workshop**. This repository contains several exercises that might help you get up to speed and learn Gradle basics.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 8 or above (JRE is not sufficient as we need javac)

**Explanation:** The recommended way to run a Gradle build is with the help of Gradle Wrapper (in short just "wrapper").
The wrapper is a script committed into Git that invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary. 

## Getting Started

- Get the source code by either:
    * Clone this repository - `git clone https://github.com/kob-aha/gradle-workshop.git`

    * Or, download the zip file available [here](https://github.com/kob-aha/gradle-workshop/archive/master.zip)

Once you finished getting the repository code, head to [Exercise 1](exercises/exercise-1) to start learning Gradle.
